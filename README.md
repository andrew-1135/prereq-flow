# prereq-flow

Prereq Flow is an unofficial course planning aid for University of Washington students that visualizes courses and prerequisites in undergraduate degrees.

Powered by [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/) in the front and [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) in the back. Built with [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/) and hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

~~Live here: https://prereqflow.com~~

Turns out that domains can't be transferred within 60 days of registration, so for now prereqflow.com will redirect to https://prereq-flow.vercel.app/.
